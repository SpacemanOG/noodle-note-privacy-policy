# NoodleNote Privacy Policy
Effective Date: September 08, 2025
NoodleNote ("We," "Us," or "Our") is a Flutter-based mobile application designed for pre-primary and early-years educators to streamline student observation, record-keeping, and progress tracking. This Privacy Policy explains how We collect, use, disclose, and protect personal information, with special emphasis on children's data in compliance with the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). We do not display ads, sell data for marketing, or use third-party trackers beyond essential services.
By using NoodleNote, you agree to this Policy. If you are a parent or guardian, review this for details on your child's data.

## Our Commitment to Data Privacy:
- We collect only data necessary for educational purposes.
- No data is shared for advertising or unrelated uses.
- We prioritize security and transparency, especially for student information.

## Compliance with Privacy Laws:
We comply with COPPA for children under 13 and FERPA for student educational records. Teachers or schools may provide consent on behalf of parents for school-based activities under COPPA. For FERPA, We act as a "school official" with legitimate educational interests when processing data at the direction of educators or institutions. Parental consent is verified through schools; direct collection from children requires verifiable parental consent. We do not collect biometric or precise location data.

## Information We Collect:
We collect the following categories of data:

### Children's Personal Information (Students Under 13)
- Full names, dates of birth, gender, roll numbers, admission dates.
- Class and school information.
- Educational observation data, including ratings, comments, anecdotal notes, ATL assessments, and potentially images or evidence files.

### User/Educator Information
- Names, email addresses, professional roles, organization affiliations.
- Login timestamps, usage patterns, account creation, and last login dates.

### Organization/School Data
- School name, address, contact details, type, and level.

### Educational Content and AI-Generated Data
- Student observation records, AI-improved text.
- AI-generated content: Comprehensive developmental reports, recommendations, pattern analysis, personalized suggestions, home support guidance.
- Report metadata: Timestamps, teacher attribution, cache keys, PDF export records.

Data is collected via user input, app usage, and integrations. No automatic collection from children; data is entered by educators.

## How We Use Your Information:

We use data for
- Educational record-keeping, student progress tracking.
- Teacher collaboration, administrative reporting, analytics.
- AI-powered text improvement and report generation using Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) models such as Google Gemini.
- Providing dashboards, summaries, and AI tips for learning strategies.

### AI Processing Details
- Text Improvement: Processes single observations for grammar, clarity, and pronoun accuracy (using gender data), with a 60-minute cooldown.
- Report Generation: Analyzes full student profiles, including all observations, ratings, and ATL domains, to create 4-section reports (summary, strategies, home tips, recommendations).
- Bulk data is sent to GenAI for longitudinal analysis, patterns, and personalized insights.
- Reports are cached locally (via ReportCacheService) for performance, exportable as PDFs, and include teacher attribution.
- GenAI models such as Google Gemini may not retain data for AI training; We opt out of such use if and when explicitely asked.
- AI has access to complete developmental histories for analysis.

Uses are limited to service provision; no marketing.

## Sharing and Disclosure:
We share data only as needed:
- Within your organization (e.g., teachers sharing student data).
- With parents for their child's information.
- For administrative reporting in schools.

## Third Parties:
- Google (Firebase for storage/authentication, Gemini for AI): Data is processed under Google's policies (see https://policies.google.com/privacy). Cross-border transfers comply with applicable data protection laws via contracts.
- No other third parties unless required by law (e.g., legal requests).

We do not sell or rent data. Sharing with Google is for service delivery only, with no use for ads or training.

## Data Storage and Security:
- Backend: Firebase Firestore (Google Cloud) with encryption and security standards.
- Local: SharedPreferences for timestamps; reports cached locally until cleared or app uninstalled.
- Safeguards: Role-based access, HTTPS encryption, authentication, organization isolation.

We maintain reasonable measures against unauthorized access, but no system is infallible. In case of a breach, We notify affected parties as required by law.

## Data Retention and Deletion:
- Student Records: Retained for the entire pre-primary school years plus legal requirements (e.g., FERPA/COPPA).
- User Accounts: Active plus grace period after deactivation.
- AI Logs/Caches: Cleared on app uninstall or user request.
- Deletion: Account deletion removes user data; parents/guardians can request student data deletion; schools can remove organization data.

## Your Rights and Controls:

### Parental Rights (COPPA/FERPA)
- Access, review, correct, or delete your child's data.
- Refuse further collection/use or withdraw consent.
- Request data portability or opt-out of processing.
- Contact your school administrator or Us; We verify identity.

### General User Rights
- Access/download account data.
- Correct/update information.
- Delete account with data removal.
- Manage privacy preferences.

## Observation Data Deletion

Teachers use NoodleNote to create anecdotal observations about their students. At the end of the school year, the school authorities decide how to manage this teacher-generated data:
- Carry Forward: The data can be retained and linked to the new school year, becoming part of the studentâ€™s ongoing developmental record.
- Delete: The data can be removed if the student is no longer enrolled at the school.

For any queries related to data deletion, please contact your school authorities. The NoodleNote team will act on official requests submitted by the school.
